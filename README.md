# Java Inheritance and Method Overriding Lab5

In Java, Inheritance represents the relationship between classes, akin to the way children inherit traits from their parents. It enables one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, fostering a hierarchy where a subclass (child) can access and utilize features of its superclass (parent). 

On the other hand, Method Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. It's similar to a child altering a skill they learned from a parent, adjusting or redefining it to suit their own unique style or needs within the family framework of classes. This concept allows for flexibility and customization in how inherited methods behave in different parts of the program.

## Lab Objective

- Use inheritance in Java to create class hierarchies.
- Override methods to provide specific implementations in subclasses.
- Understand assignments between objects of superclasses and subclasses.
- Utilize the `instanceof` operator to check object types.
- Test objects equality using overridden `equals()` method.

### Files Included

- **Main.java**: Contains the main code to demonstrate inheritance, method overriding, and object assignments.
- **Person.java**: Defines the base class `Person` with fields and methods.
- **Employee.java**: Extends `Person` and represents an employee with additional fields and methods.
- **Student.java**: Extends `Person` and represents a student with class status.
- **Faculty.java**: Extends `Employee` and represents a faculty member with specific attributes.
- **Staff.java**: Extends `Employee` and represents a staff member with specific attributes.

### Instructions

1. Review the hierarchy and relationships among classes.
2. Observe how inheritance is used to pass down characteristics from superclasses to subclasses.
3. Note how method overriding allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of inherited methods.
4. Experiment with assignments between objects of superclasses and subclasses.
5. Utilize `instanceof` to check the types of objects.
6. Test object equality using overridden `equals()` method.

Enjoy exploring Java inheritance and method overriding!
